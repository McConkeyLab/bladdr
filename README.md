# bladdr: A Helping Hand in McConkey Land <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" />

bladdr's vision is to be a package that can automate everyday days in small functions that don't try to do too much. 

# Guiding Principles

## Reproducibility

Any output of these functions should produce a report with all relevant information.

## Clarity

Functions should strive to be simple over elegant when one must be decided over the other

## Modularization

Functions should only do one thing: creating two small functions, one which feeds into the other, is preferred over one larger function
