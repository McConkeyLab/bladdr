# bladdr: A Helping Hand in McConkey Land <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" />

bladdr is a 'miscellaneous' toolbox made for the McConkey lab, but useful to many who do routine lab tasks. Its vision is to be a package that can automate everyday days in small functions that don't try to do too much. 

# Overview

Generally, bladdr has several 'groups' of functions

- PCR functions, used to plan, analyze, and visualize the results of both ddPCR experiments and RNA library quantification PCR.

- EDA functions, which take a `SummarizedExperiment` object to visualize expression of gene(s) across optional strata

- Helpers, like `dilute`, `make_pipette_vol`, `theme_tufte`, and others.
